*stClinic dissects clinically relevant niches by integrating spatial multi-slice multi-omics data in dynamic graphs.*

## Overview

![image](https://github.com/JunjieXia14/stClinic/blob/main/image/stClinic_logo.png)

stClinic is able to integrate spatial multi-slice omics data from the same tissue or different tissues, and spatial multi-omics data from the same slice or different slices/technologies..

## Installation

Installation was tested on Ubuntu 22.10 with Python 3.8.17, Scanpy 1.9.3, PyTorch 1.12.0, and PyG (PyTorch Geometric) 2.3.0 on a machine with one 40-core Intel(R) Xeon(R) Silver 4210R CPU addressing with 128GB RAM, and one NVIDIA A800 GPU addressing 80GB. Please run stClinic on CUDA if possible.

### 1. Grab source code of stClinic

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JunjieXia14/stClinic.git
cd stClinic-main
```

### 2. Install stClinic in the virtual environment by conda

* Firstly, install conda: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/index.html
* Then, automatically install all used packages (described by "environment.yml") for stClinic in a few mins.

```bash
conda config --set channel_priority strict
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate stClinic
```

Other software dependencies are listed in "requirements.txt".

## Quick start

### Unsupervised stClinic for integrating multiple slices

#### Input

We take the human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) dataset of 10X Visium (four slices: 151673-151676) generated by Maynard et al. (*Nature Neuroscience*, 2021) as an example input, which includes three types of files: (1) gene expression data, (2) spatial location data, and (3) annotation labels for each spot. These input files are available at `Datasets/README.md`.

Note that you should first define the installation paths for the R software as well as the rpy2 package.

#### Run

Run the following commands in Linux Bash Shell:

```bash
cd Tutorials/code
python DLPFC_Unsupervised_Integration.py
```

The script automatically (1) loads the input data as concatenated `AnnData` object, (2) builds an initial unified graph based on spatial locations and omics profiles, (3) learns batch-corrected features of four slices by stClinic in an unsupervised manner, (4) identifies spatial domains based on batch-corrected features using the `mclust` algorithm, and (5) maps the latent features into 2D-UMAP space.

**Hyperparameters**

* rad_cutoff: The radius value used to construct intra-edge (i.e., spatial nearest neighbors) for each slice. And the k_cutoff defines
* k_cutoff: The number of spatial neighbors used to construct intra-edge. The default value is 6.
* k: The number of mutual nearest neighbors used to construct inter-edges across slices. In heterogeneous tissues such as tumors, the value is set to 5; in spatial multi-omics dataset, the value is set to 10; and in relatively homogeneous tissues, the value is 1 or 0.
* n_top_genes: The number of highly variable genes selected for each slice. The default value is 5000, which can be larger than the default for heterogeneous datasets.
* n_centroids: The number of components of the GMM.
* lr: The learning rate used by stClinic when extracting batch-corrected features in slices. The default value is 0.0005. You can adjust it from 0.0005/20 to 0.0005 based on your data.
* input_dir: defines the directory of input data files.
* path: defines the directory of output data files. The default value is './DLPFC'.

#### Output

An concatenated `AnnData` object with stClinic embeddings and UMAP coordinates of four slices stored in `AnnData.obsm`, and spatial cluster labels stored in `AnnData.obs.mclust`.

Note: To reduce your waiting time, we have uploaded the processed `AnnData` object into `Datasets/DLPFC`.

### Supervised stClinic for predicting clinically relevant TMEs

#### Input

We take the human colorectal cancer and liver metastasis (CRCLM) dataset of 10X Visium (24 slices) generated by Villemin et al. (*Nucleic Acids Research*, 2023), Valdeolivas et al. (*npj Precision Oncology*, 2024), Wu et al. (*Cancer Discovery*, 2022), Garbarino et al. (*Aging Cell*, 2023), Wang et al. (*Science Advances*, 2023) as an example input for supervised mode of stClinic, which includes three types of files: (1) gene expression data, (2) spatial location data, and (3) sample labels. These input files are available at `Datasets/README.md`.

#### Run

We firstly run the following commands in Linux Bash Shell to (1) learn shared features of 24 CRCLM slices, (2) identifies spatial domains according to the joint embeddings by `Louvain` algorithm, and (3) project the latent features into 2D-UMAP space.

```bash
cd Tutorials/code
python CRCLM_Unsupervised_Integration.py
```

Note: To reduce your waiting time, we have uploaded the processed `AnnData` object into `Datasets/CRCLM`.

We then run the following command in Linux Bash Shell:

```bash
python CRCLM_Supervised_Prediction.py
```

This script automatically (1) computes 6 statistics measures of each cluster, (2) fuses them into slice representations by attention mechanism, (3) predicts condition-specific TMEs with the highest cluster contribution scores on different clinical states.

**Hyperparameters**

* pred_type: The type of clinical data. The value is 'survival' when using survival time; and the value is 'grading' when using categorical data.
* lr: The learning rate used by supervised stClinic. The parameter is set to the value with the highest C-Index or classification accuracy in the grid search program of cross-validation.

#### Output

An `AnnData` object with stClinic embeddings and UMAP coordinates of 24 slices stored in `AnnData.obsm`, spatial cluster labels stored in `AnnData.obs.louvain`, and cluster contribution scores stored in `AnnData.uns`.
